1) The current crossover file was designed to take a simualted route from the TSP Problem
 - This need to be translated into input from the Nueroevolution GA
 - get rid of the routes

2) Need to transfer the crossover functions to there own files so that all of the logic is concise

3) Need to make a test main.
